"""Judging a model: metrics, and the folds to compute them over.

:func:`precision`, :func:`recall`, :func:`f1_score` and :func:`iou` accept either
label series (scored per sample) or :class:`~hazure.events.Events` (scored per
interval), and a dict of either to score several anomaly types at once. They say
whether an outage was caught. :func:`detection_delay` and
:func:`detection_delays` say how late, which is the other half of the question
and is not visible in any of the four.

:func:`average_precision` and :func:`roc_auc` need no threshold at all. They
score a continuous score directly, by how well it *ranks* the anomalous samples,
which is the only way to judge a :class:`~hazure.BaseScorer` without also judging
the fence you put around it.

:func:`split_train_test` builds time-ordered folds. Shuffling is not an option for
a time series, so the four schemes it offers differ in how the training window
grows and where the test block sits.
