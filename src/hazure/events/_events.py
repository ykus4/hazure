"""Anomalous time intervals as a value object.

An anomaly is usually a stretch of time, not a point: a level shift lasts until
the level shifts back, and a spike observed on hourly data occupies the whole
hour. :class:`Events` is hazure's representation of a set of such stretches.

It maintains one invariant, established on construction: the intervals are
sorted by start and never overlap or touch. That is what lets the set operations
below be a single sorted sweep rather than a nested scan, and it is what makes
``to_events(to_labels(events))`` give back exactly ``events``.

        Shape ``(n_events, 2)`` of UTC nanoseconds, ``[start, end]`` with both
