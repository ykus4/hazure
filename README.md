You have a metric — requests per second, queue depth, a sensor reading — you
suspect it occasionally misbehaves, and you have no record of when it did.
`hazure` finds those moments: rule-based and unsupervised detectors that learn
what "normal" looks like from the series itself, and that say where it stopped
holding.

Any pandas, polars or pyarrow object with a time axis goes in, and the answer
comes back in the same flavour. At runtime it needs `narwhals` and `numpy` and
nothing else; every heavier dependency is an extra, imported lazily by the
algorithm that needs it.

```bash
pip install hazure[pandas]
```

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from hazure.detection import SeasonalDetector
from hazure.events import to_events

# Hourly traffic with a daily rhythm — and one afternoon that went wrong.
rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
index = pd.date_range("2024-03-01", periods=24 * 21, freq="h", name="time")
daily = 40 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * np.arange(len(index)) / 24)
traffic = pd.Series(100 + daily + rng.normal(0, 3, len(index)), index=index, name="rps")
traffic.iloc[300:306] = 20.0

labels = SeasonalDetector(period=24).fit_detect(traffic)
print(to_events(labels))
# Events([2024-03-13T12:00:00..2024-03-13T17:59:59.999999999])
```

`labels` sits on `traffic`'s own index — `1.0` anomalous, `0.0` normal, `NaN`
unknown — and the six flagged hours are exactly the six that were planted.

Everything is one of five composable component types (`Scorer`, `Threshold`,
`Detector`, `Aggregator`, `Transformer`), chained with `Pipeline` and wired with
`Graph` when the model branches.

## On a series that is still arriving

Fit once on a period you are willing to call normal, then feed observations in as
they come. `Stream` runs the *same* fitted component over a buffer of recent
history, so the online answer is the batch answer rather than a second
implementation of it — and `prime` refuses to start if the buffer is too short for
what the component looks back over, instead of quietly computing from a window
that was never full.

```python
from hazure import Stream

detector = SeasonalDetector(period=24).fit(traffic)
stream = Stream(detector, history=48).prime(traffic)

stream.update("2024-03-22T00:00", 105.0)  # in line with the fortnight -> 0.0
stream.update("2024-03-22T01:00", 12.0)  # not in line with it -> 1.0
```

## Where to draw the line

Every threshold is parameterised by *something*, and none of those somethings is
"the answer I want". Two ways to get one. `PotThreshold` takes the false-alarm
probability directly — it fits a generalised Pareto to the tail of the training
scores, so the fence can be placed where exceedance has probability `1e-4`, beyond
the largest score ever observed. And `budget_threshold` needs no labels at all:
give it the number of alerts a week anyone will read, and it lowers the fence as
far as that allows and no further.
